# Expanding on this CLI
Before writing any code for this project I spent a good amount of time familiarizing myself with Socrates. The documentation made it clear that using their provided SoQL language was the simplest way to retrieve the necessary data. A form for user input could make searching for trucks open during a certain time, or serving certain types of food simple and quick. Searching by map location would not be unrealistic using the longititude and latitude columns. Displaying more information about each truck would only require adding more attributes to the `Truck` class.
