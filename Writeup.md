# Expanding on this CLI
Before writing any code I spent a good amount of time familiarizing myself with the Socrates API. Their documentation made it clear using the provided SoQL language was the simplest way to retrieve necessary data. To expand on this CLI I would convert this current Ruby build to a Rails MVC architecture. Adding controllers and views for the current models would give the user options to influence the API request.

Implementing a form allows searching for trucks open during a specific time, serving certain types of food, or finding trucks by map location using the longitude and latitude columns. The data source sends back plenty of information about each truck. Adding those details to the view components only requires more attributes in the `Truck` class. Integrating the larger dataset [Mobile Food Facility Permit](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat) would allow me to cross-reference the permit numbers, and expand on the information displayed for the user. I have not checked the data, it appears that the location column in the more comprehensive dataset would make locating by a map GUI easier. 

There is a lot to be said about adding a `User` class and a backend to this project. It opens up the possibility of this app going mobile and being a food truck specific information service.
